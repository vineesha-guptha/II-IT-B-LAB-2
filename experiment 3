# aim of the experiment
to find the key values in linear_recursion_search
# brief description about linear search
• Sequential search is used whenever the list is not ordered.
• Generally we use the technique only for small lists or lists that are
not
 searched often.
• In the sequential search , we start searching for the target from the
 beginning of the list, and we continue until the we find the target or
 until we are sure that it is not in the list.
• This gives us two possibilities:
either we find it or
we reach the end of the list
