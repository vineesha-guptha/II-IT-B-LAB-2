# aim of the experiment
to find the values in iterative_linear_search
# biref descrption of linear search
• Sequential search is used whenever the list is not ordered.
• Generally we use the technique only for small lists or lists that are
not
 searched often.
• In the sequential search , we start searching for the target from the
 beginning of the list, and we continue until the we find the target or
 until we are sure that it is not in the list.
• This gives us two possibilities:
either we find it or
we reach the end of the list

# step by step procedure explaining each output

=> we have  the array elements[10,6,8,15,20,3,14,99,66,30]
=> for the output 1 the key element we need to search is 66
=> in tne iterative process we check if the element and the key value are same
=> in iteration 1 a[0] = 10 key is not equal to 66,so the case fails
=> in iteration 2 a[1] =  6 key is not equal to 66,so the case fails
=> in iteration 3 a[2] =  8 key is not equal to 66,so the case fails
=> similarly iteration continues until the element and key value are same
=> in iteration 9 a[8] =  66 is equal to 66 so case passed
=>  in the function the iteration takes place and the element with index printed to the output
=>  if all the iteration cases falis the it returns element not found to the output,
